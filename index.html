                <p>As the basis of my project, I will conduct a data-based investigation of Tolstoy’s use of happiness,
                    joy,
                    and rapture (счастье, радость, & восторг) in the novel and compare the data-based perspective with
                    existing scholarship
                    pertaining to the characterization of selected characters throughout the novel. I
                    will draw my data from the Russian text, search for forms of the keywords above in the vicinity of
                    different characters (Andrei, Pierre, & Natasha). I also will look at other
                    words or concepts that frequently occur in the vicinity of these keywords and characters in order to
                    examine the settings (at the front vs. in the salon), gestures (laughter, tears, speech, etc.), or
                    objects (eyes, smile, sky, etc.) that are associated with the happiness of different characters. It
                    is my hypothesis that (1) different characters are more predisposed toward certain intensities of
                    joy (<i>schast'ye</i> being the most reserved, <i>vostorg</i> being most intense, and <i>radost'</i>
                    somewhere in the
                    middle), and/or (2) that Tolstoy includes repeated, subtle associations between happiness and other
                    words that may differ across characters or time. Because of the project’s emphasis on word choice, I
                    investigate the etymological differences between these word and discuss the implications of the
                    words used in translation for <i>schast’ye</i>, <i>radost’</i>, and <i>vostorg</i>. Lastly, I hope
                    to briefly discuss the
                    advantages and disadvantages to examining literature as data.</p>
                <h3 id='datamethods'>II. Data methods:</h3>
                <p>
                    I scraped the full Russian version of <i>War and Peace</i> from this website: <a
                        href='https://ilibrary.ru/text/11/index.html'
                        target="_blank">https://ilibrary.ru/text/11/index.html</a>.
                    Using Python in Jupyter Lab, I assembled my own dataset of the Russian text, using tools from <a
                        href='https://github.com/natasha' target='_blank'>Natasha</a>, Alexander Kukushkin's extensive
                    GitHub respository for Russian natural language processing tasks.
                    I mostly made use of <a href='https://github.com/natasha/slovnet' target='_blank'>Slovnet</a>,
                    Kukushkin's deep learning model for Russian, to lemmatize words, since I was interested in finding
                    all forms of words (like <i>schast'ye</i>, <i>schastlivy</i>, <i>schastlivo</i>, etc.).
                    At this point, I searched through the parts of <i>War and Peace</i> for paragraphs where both a
                    character and one of the happiness keywords appeared.
                    The "happiness keywords" used in my analysis were <i>schast'ye</i> (happiness), <i>radost'</i>,
                    (joy) and <i>vostorg</i> (rapture/delight).
                    I assembled a set of paragraphs that contained character/happiness associations, making note of the
                    volume, part, and chapter of the example, the character mentioned, and the "type" of happiness
                    involved. I was able to find these paragraphs by looping over all the paragraphs in the novel,
                    breaking each paragraph down word by word, converting those words into lemmas (standard dictionary forms of the word),
                    and checking to see if the lemma matched one of the character names (Andrei, Pierre, or Natasha) or one of the happpiness
                    lemmas of interest (happiness, joy, rapture).
                    Because characters are often referred to by more than one name or nickname, I checked multiple names variations for each character:
                    Andrei is also referred to Bolkonsky by his military compatriots and Andrusha by Princess Marya. Pierre is referred to as 
                    Pyotr Kirillovich on occasion (or Bezukhov) and Natasha is occasionally referred to by her French nickname, Nathalie. 
                    It is also necessary to check for different grammatical forms of their names,
                    since Andrei's name will change to <i>Andreya</i> in the genitive case.
                    I went through those paragraphs that contained more than one character name to try to disambiguate
                    <i>which</i> character in particular was associated with happiness during that paragraph and removed
                    by hand anything clearly mis-attributed.
                    I used the resulting lists of associations for Andrei, Pierre, and Natasha to build the count-based
                    visualizations below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data files for all the data below are in .csv or .json format, although they could be converted to Excel if required.
                    I built all the visualizations below in <b><a href='https://d3js.org/' target='_blank'>D3</a></b>, a Javascript library and framework for data visualization.
                    D3 creates visualizations by binding the data and graphical elements to the Document Object Model. 
                    These visualizations are loosely based on simple graph examples, like the line chart, stacked area chart, stacked bar chart, and
                    <a href='https://bl.ocks.org/alokkshukla/3d6be4be0ef9f6977ec6718b2916d168' target='_blank'>bubble chart</a>.

                    D3 binds data-based elements to the Document Object Model, which means that the graphs are all interactive and
                    are associated with other elements on the web page. All of the code on the webpage is HTML, CSS, or Javascript-based, although my analysis was
                    conducted in Python. My highly cluttered GitHub code base with works in progress and failed tries is <a href='https://github.com/eelegiap/digitalwp'target='_blank'>here</a>: and the code for this webpage in particular is <a href=''target='_blank'>here</a>.

                <p>This project is interested in occurrences of the words happiness, joy, and rapture when used in the
                    context of contentment, pleasure, and emotional happiness, although these words can have alternate
                    meanings (like
                    "happy coincidence," where happy is more akin to fortunate). Definitions and etymology are
                    taken from the Oxford English Dictionary online.
                    Russian definitions come from Kuznetsov's <i>Comprehensive Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian
                        Language</i>. Russian etymology from Vasmer's <i>Etymological Dictionary of the Russian
                        Language</i> (Translations of excerpts from both Russian dictionaries are my own).

                <h3 id='wordchoice'>IV. Discussion of Russian and English definitions and etymology</h3>
                <p>
                    Because this project deals with the Russian text, I am concerned with the specific words
                    <i>schast'ye</i>, <i>radost'</i>, and <i>vostorg</i> -- the words used in English translations may
                    vary among happiness, gladness, joy, delight, rapture, and other close synonyms.
                    However, the most common substitution for <i>schast'ye</i> is happiness, <i>radost'</i> is joy, and
                    <i>vostorg</i> is rapture or delight, depending on the translation.
                    The words happiness and <i>schast'ye</i> have a very close correspondence based on their etymology,
                    both derived from the original meaning of "good fortune" or "good lot."
                    Joy and <i>radost'</i> have a less clear etymological link. The English word joy comes from the
                    Latin verb <i>gaudere</i>, "to rejoice," while the etymological origins of <i>radost'</i> are much
                    less clear.
                    Rapture and <i>vostorg</i> both have interesting alternate definitions and etymological histories.
                    They follow similar grammatical structure "to be in rapture" and "<i>byt' v vostorg'ye</i>".
                    Both originate from roots of conveyance and transportation. Rapture has religious connotations in
                    English, and while
                    <i>vostorg</i> does not have explicitly religious roots, the prefix <i>voz</i> is associated with
                    religious terminology like <i>Voznesenie</i>/Вознесение, or Ascension Day.
                    Although the <i>Oxford Russian-English Dictionary</i> defines <i>vostorg</i> as "delight, rapture,"
                    rapture seems to be a more apt translation of <i>vostorg</i> because of their religious associations
                    which delight lacks.
                    "Ecstasy" (1. the state of being ‘beside oneself’, thrown into a frenzy or a stupor, with anxiety,
                    astonishment, fear, or passion. 2. an exalted state of feeling which engrosses the mind to the
                    exclusion of thought; rapture, transport.)
                    is sometimes also used in place of <i>vostorg</i> in English translations, but ecstasy is not as
                    associated with pleasure and good feeling as words like delight and rapture.
                    I refer to the following pairs -- happy/<i>schast'ye</i>, joy/<i>radost'</i>, and
                    rapture/<i>vostorg</i> -- for the purposes of my project
                    because their definitions generally line up in terms of intensity of happiness
                    (happy/<i>schast'ye</i> being least intense, joy/<i>radost'</i> next most intense, and
                    rapture/<i>vostorg</i> most intense).
                    The English definitions of these Russian words in the <i>Oxford Russian-English Dictionary</i>
                    correspond with this ranking,
                    but the ranking is not entirely clear based on the Russian definitions from the <i>Comprehensive
                        Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian
                        Language</i>. More investigation of Russian dictionaries would be helpful in disambiguating the
                    subtle emotional differences between <i>schast'ye</i> and <i>radost'</i>.

                <p>
                    I compare a few English translations of <i>War and Peace</i> to see the usual translations of the
                    words <i>schast'ye</i>, <i>radost'</i>, and <i>vostorg</i>.
                    In this project, I am primarily concerned with the Russian word choice, but of course, the choices
                    in English translation are highly impactful
                    on how readers perceive the characters and the novel as a whole and raise questions about the
                    subtleties of translating emotional states.

                <p>The translations of <i>schast'ye</i> and <i>radost'</i> are overall very consistent across the
                    translations. In Garnett's early translation, she translates one instance of <i>schastlivymi</i> as
                    "blissful" instead of "happy." Maude, in 1922, translates <i>radost'</i> as "pleasure" while the
                    other two translations translate it as "joy."</p>

                    смысл жизни, не для него одного, но для всего мира, казался ему заключающимся только в его любви и в
                    возможности ее любви к нему. Иногда все люди казались ему занятыми только одним — его будущим
                    <span class='счастье'>СЧАСТЬЕМ</span>. Ему казалось иногда, что все они <span

                    эту <span class='радость'>РАДОСТЬ</span>, притворяясь занятыми другими интересами. В каждом слове и
                    движении он видел намеки на

                    согласие, <span class='счастье'>СЧАСТЛИВЫМИ</span> взглядами и улыбками. Но когда он понимал, что

                    заняты, есть совершенный вздор и пустяки, не стоящие внимания.

                <p>This excerpt highlights the various ways to translate <i>vostorg</i>. Respectively, the Garnett,
                    Maude, and P&V translations translate <i>vostorzhennaya</i> (an adjectival form of <i>vostorg</i>)
                    as "passionate," "ecstatic," and "rapturous." Where <i>vostorg</i> shows up earlier in the
                    paragraph, the two later translators translate it as "rapture," while Garnett translated it as
                    "ecstatic enjoyment." Although "ecstatic enjoyment" seems closer to <i>vostorg</i> than "ecstasy"
                    alone (see etymology section), this unusual word combination probably obfuscates more than
                    necessary.</p>

                <h2>VII. Discussion and analysis of the data</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Note:</b> I would like to spend more time analyzing the data and visualizations in the context of the novel, but
                    the data scraping and visualizations were very time-consuming processes, so I did not have much
                    time left for extended analysis, especially because there is so much to discusss.
                    Now that the visualizations are created, I can continue on this section in the future.
                    Some of my observations are below.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Figures 1 and 2:</b> Starting with Figure 1a, we can examine the spikes in the graph to see the parts of novel where
                        the characters are associated more frequently with happiness (when their name co-occurs with one of the three happiness keywords). Prince Andrei experiences an intense 
                        spike in Volume 2, Part 3, the part when Andrei falls in love and proposes to Natasha, and notable
                        but lower spikes in Volume 1, Part 2 (the Battle of Schongraben) and Volume 3, Part 3 (the Battle of Borodino).
                        Pierre experiences two peaks in the first half of the novel in Volume 1, Part 3 (Pierre's engagement to Helene) 
                        and Volume 2, Part 2 (Pierre's introduction to Masonry). However, Pierre's highest peak comes in Volume 4, Part 4 
                        (Pierre's reunion with Natasha) and stays similarly high in Part 1 of the Epilogue, which describes Pierre and Natasha's family life.
                        Natasha experiences her highest peak in Volume 2, Part 3, the same point as Andrei's highest peak (Andrei's proposal to Natasha).
                        Natasha's second highest peak is in Volume 4, Part 4 (her reunion with Pierre). There is a general lull during
                        Volume 3, which focuses on the French invasion into Russia in 1812.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Figures 2a and 2b:</b> Figures 2a and 2b both offer breakdowns of <i>schast’ye</i>, <i>radost’</i>, and <i>vostorg</i>,
                        2a for the three characters in question, and 2b for the 17 parts of the novel. Therefore, 2a compares "happiness breakdown by character"
                        while 2b is "happiness breakdown over time." We also get an idea of differences in total 
                        happiness counts -- in 2a, we see Andrei having less than half the number of happiness
                        examples as both Pierre and Natasha. Pierre has the most examples, just barely more than Natasha.
                        In terms of proportions, <i>vostorg</i> makes up only 7% of Andrei's examples, 17% of Pierre's, and 14% of Natasha's.
                        This may point to Tolstoy's characterization of Andrei who is essentially serious, not prone to the 
                        "rapture" or "ecstasy" that Pierre and Natasha experience more frequently. 
                        Indeed, the only co-occurrence of Andrei and <i>vostorg</i> in the second half of book occurs when
                        he is severely injured and half-conscious during his reunion with Natasha.
                        Andrei has essentially the same number of <i>schasty'e</i> and <i>radost'</i> exampples,
                        while Pierre's data slightly leans toward <i>radost'</i> and Natasha towards <i>schast'ye</i>.
                        Figure 2b clearly shows that Part 6 (Volume 2, Part 3), is the part of the book with the highest 
                        happiness count, overshadowing neighboring parts by two times. It is almost 33% taller than the next
                        tallest bar, which is Volume 4, Part 4 (Natasha and Pierre's reunion). Part 6 has an extremely high 
                        bar because of the alignment of Natasha and Andrei's peaks, which you can see in Figure 1a. Alignment to
                        that degree does not occur elsewhere.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Figure 3:</b> In general, words (excluding stopwords like <i>он, это, который, то</i>, etc.) 
                        that were highly associated with happiness were <i>litso</i> (face), <i>govorit'</i> (to say),
                        <i>moch'</i> (to be able to/can), <i>chelovek</i> (person).
                        The top words 
                        for Prince Andrei was <i>zhizn'</i> (life), Pierre's were <i>govorit'</i> (to speak) and 
                        <i>chelovek</i> (person), and Natasha's was <i>govorit'</i>. Some words that occurred with 
                        certain characters more often than others: Andrei's cloud includes <i>voyenniy</i> (military)
                        while Natasha and Pierre's did not, for obvious reasons. Pierre's cloud notably includes
                        <i>dusha</i> (soul), while Natasha's does not, even though the two characters have similar number
                        of examples in the database. This difference may have something to do with the differences
                        in interiority that Tolstoy lends to his characters. Natasha is the only one of the three
                        characters with a notable number of occurrences with <i>vesyoliy</i> (merry/cheerful). The 
                        occurrence of this word along with the other keywords indicates that Natasha's episodes of happiness
                        are generally quite intense and involve several synonyms for happy.

                <h3 style='color: gray'>Limitations of the data and methods</h3>
                <p>
                    Several issues arise from a data-based look at happiness in <i>War and Peace</i>. For one, the dataset which I have assembled does not perfectly represent all co-occurrences of Andrei, Pierre, and Natasha with <i>schast’ye</i>, <i>radost’</i>, and <i>vostorg</i>.
                    Because of the way I scraped the data, it's possible that there are paragraphs that mention a certain character and a certain keyword, but that character might not be experiencing that particular word. 
                    This is something that is difficult to search and ascertain in a text because of the difficulties of computer "understanding" of language, a problem that requires more complex analytic methods than I had access to.
                    Computer understanding of natural languages is a field of study that is thought to be "<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete' target='_blank'>AI-complete</a>", the set of the most difficult problems in artificial intelligence.
                    For that reason, my study is exploratory in both technique and analysis, and I hope that applying different idioms of digital humanities will lead to an array of results from which to accept and discard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Happiness" is also a deeply imperfect metric. I only look at 3 keywords that pertain to happiness. There are many other synonyms for happiness
                    and many other ways that characters may "experience" happy emotions in the book (smiling, laughing, etc.). Thus, the examples
                    here show more of the "telling" than the "showing" that Tolstoy is doing in his writing. Additionally,
                    looking for these three keywords gives us some examples which don't necessary indicate that a character is happy.
                    It's possible that the sentence says something in the negative, like "Pierre did not feel happiness because...", 
                    something hypothetical, like "Natasha would have been so happy if...", or something unrelated to current
                    happiness, like "Andrei considered the pursuit of happiness a fruitless task." Because of the ambiguity of
                    language and difficulty in clearly defining meaning for a computer, examples like these find themselves in my dataset,
                    although I tried my best to clean it up as possible.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, since visualization is such an individual experience that relies heavily on the subjectivity of visual perception, the graphs above may not be the best way
                    of showing the data that I have collected. In some cases, I had to make arbitrary choices about how to present data that
                    spanned the whole novel: rather than breaking down by page or individual chapter, I opted to go by part. In this instance, the graph 
                    will be not be entirely "accurate" in terms of happiness over time, since there are some parts which have more chapters than others. 
                    I have also chosen to "round out" the lines in Figure 1a and Figure 1b to emphasize the continuity of the novel's plot, although it should be made
                    clear that the data is discrete for each chapter.
                </p>
                <h3 style='color: gray'>Further questions and directions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Etymology:</b> The differences in translation of <i>schast'ye</i>/счастье,
                        <i>radost'</i>/радость, & <i>vostorg</i>/восторг suggest that there are unanswered questions about 
                        the emotional subtleties of the definitions of these Russian words. I also need more sources about
                        the etymology of <i>radost'</i> to have a clearer picture of its origins.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Word choice and translation:</b> I was not able to cover all the translations of <i>War and Peace</i> and only looked at a few excerpts.
                        Choosing more excerpts to analyze would help us learn more about the differences between <i>schast’ye</i>, <i>radost’</i>, and <i>vostorg</i>,
                        particularly in this novel. It would also be prudent to look at other words which indicate happy emotion in Russian,
                        like <i>vesel'ye</i>/веселье.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Happiness and Tolstoy</b>: It would be instructive from a different angle to look instances of <i>schast’ye</i>, <i>radost’</i>, and <i>vostorg</i>
                        across Tolstoy's work, across time. Is <i>War and Peace</i> a representative example of Tolstoy's relationship with these words in his writing?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Characterization:</b> Examining more characters (like Marya, Nikolai, Sonya) would give us a fuller picture of Tolstoy's
                        relationship with <i>schast’ye</i>, <i>radost’</i>, and <i>vostorg</i> in the novel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Technical:</b> A great deal of progress is still needed to perfect this dataset. It would probably require a paragraph by paragraph examination of the book
                        to find all instances of happiness and appropriately link them with different characters. The visualizations above can be
                        refined, and novel visualizations can be built to provide more informative views of the data. More complex statistical analysis is also necessary.
